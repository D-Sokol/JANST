# JANST
Just Another Neural StyleTransfer

This repository contains another implementation of neural style transfer based on the article [A Neural Algorithm of Artistic Style](https://arxiv.org/abs/1508.06576).

One can find some ST examples in [this Tensorflow tutorial](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/generative/style_transfer?hl=en).
Disclaimer: JANST code may differ from one in the tutorial and/or contain very minor serious errors.
